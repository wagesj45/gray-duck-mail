Begins tracking the given entity and entries reachable from the given entity using the [Unchanged()][29] state by default, but see below for cases when a different state will be used.

Generally, no database interaction will be performed until [SaveChanges()][21] is called.

A recursive search of the navigation properties will be performed to find reachable entities that are not already being tracked by the context. All entities found will be tracked by the context.

For entity types with generated keys if an entity has its primary key value set then it will be tracked in the [Unchanged()][29] state. If the primary key value is not set then it will be tracked in the [Added()][20] state. This helps ensure only new entities will be inserted. An entity is considered to have its primary key value set if the primary key property is set to anything other than the CLR default for the property type.

For entity types without generated keys, the state set is always [Unchanged()][29].

Use [State()][22] to set the state of only a single entity.

Gets an [EntityEntry][36] for the given entity. The entry provides access to change tracking information and operations for the entity.

This method may be called on an entity that is not tracked. You can then set the [State()][22] property on the returned entry to have the context begin tracking the entity in the specified state.

Override this method to configure the database (and other options) to be used for this context. This method is called for each instance of the context that is created. The base implementation does nothing.

In situations where an instance of [DbContextOptions][46] may or may not have been passed to the constructor, you can use [IsConfigured()][47] to determine if the options have already been set, and skip some or all of the logic in [OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder)][48].

Begins tracking the given entity and entries reachable from the given entity using the [Modified()][65] state by default, but see below for cases when a different state will be used.

Generally, no database interaction will be performed until [SaveChanges()][21] is called.

A recursive search of the navigation properties will be performed to find reachable entities that are not already being tracked by the context. All entities found will be tracked by the context.

For entity types with generated keys if an entity has its primary key value set then it will be tracked in the [Modified()][65] state. If the primary key value is not set then it will be tracked in the [Added()][20] state. This helps ensure new entities will be inserted, while existing entities will be updated. An entity is considered to have its primary key value set if the primary key property is set to anything other than the CLR default for the property type.

For entity types without generated keys, the state set is always [Modified()][65].

Use [State()][22] to set the state of only a single entity.

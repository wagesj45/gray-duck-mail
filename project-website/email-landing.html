            <strong>What's an Email Discussion List?</strong>
        </header>
        <p>
            A discussion list is a way to contact and talk to a community all at once. This could be a neighborhood, a school, a sports team, or a work team. You have one email address to remember. Send a message to your discussion list address, and it will get forwarded to everyone in your group. Any replies will also get relayed to everyone in the group. This makes it easy to contact everyone in the group at once through email.

            <strong>How Do I Use It?</strong>
        </header>
        <p>
            There are a few things you can do to control your experience with the discussion list.
        </p>
        <h5>Subscribe</h5>
        <p>
            In order to join the discussion list, you'll first need to <strong>subscribe</strong> to the list. You can do this by simply replying to the subscription email you recieved. You'll notice that the <code>To:</code> field is going to <code>subscribe-[some email address]</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <mark><i class="icofont-info-circle"></i> It doesn't matter what you send in the reply. You can leave the message blank. The only thing that matters is the address you're using to send the email matches the one you recieved the invitation to.</mark>
        </p>
        <h5>Unsubscribe</h5>
        <p>
            If you no longer wish to recieve messages from the discussion list, you can unsubscribe. If you send a message to <code>unsubscribe-[your discussion list email address]</code> from the address that you recieved the invitation to,  you'll no longer recieve messages from that group. Just like subscribing, it doesn't matter what is in the email, only that the address that you send it from matches the address that is subscribed to the discussion list.
        </p>
        <h5>Requests To Join</h5>
        <p>
            If you accidently unsubscribe, or know of a discussion list that you'd like to be a part of, you can send a message to <code>request-[your discussion list email address]</code>. If you send the message from an address that used to be subscribed, you'll be resubscribed to the discussion list. Otherwise, a message will be sent to the discussion list owner letting them know that you've requested access.'
        </p>

            <strong>Still Have Questions?</strong>
            <p>
                Still have questions? You can contact the owner of the disucssion list by emailing <code>owner-[your discussion list email address]</code>. This message will get forwarded to the owner of your discussion list so that they can address any questions you may have.
